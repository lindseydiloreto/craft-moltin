## What is Moltin?

Moltin is a cutting-edge eCommerce solution. While relatively young, it's built upon a single, brilliant concept: **a comprehensive eCommerce API**. All of the front-end components are left for you to design at will.

## How does this plugin work?

This plugin gives you full access to the Moltin API, all through the familiar interface that Craft plugins already provide. Which means it's a breeze to interact with the Moltin API by writing your own simple plugin!

## Example

**Get a product**

There are a few ways to get product information. Here's one method...

    $matches = craft()->moltin_products->find(['slug' => 'awesome-product']);
    $product = $matches[0];

**Add product to cart**

If you don't specify a quantity, it will default to `1`...

    craft()->moltin_cart->insert($product['id'], 1);

**Convert cart to order**

You'll need to convert your _cart_ to an _order_ to complete the checkout process...

    $order = craft()->moltin_cart->order(['gateway' => 'stripe']);

**Process payment**

Provide the information required by your payment gateway...

    $checkout = craft()->moltin_checkout->payment('purchase', $order['id'], [
        'data' => [
            'number'       => '4242424242424242',
            'expiry_month' => '02',
            'expiry_year'  => '2017',
            'cvv'          => '123'
        ]
    ]);

**Congratulations!** You've just completed a purchase!

## Authenticating

Your authentication info is stored in the plugin's settings, so you'll never need to authenticate. Every call will be authenticated for you.

Simply add your authentication info when you first install the plugin!
